Ingredients
    2 bunches broccolini, cut into 1-inch pieces
    1/4 small red or green cabbage, cored (about 8 ounces)
    1 1/2 cups walnuts, roughly chopped (about 8 ounces)
    2 tablespoons olive oil
    Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
    1/4 cup Basil-Walnut Vinaigrette

    Basil-Walnut Vinaigrette
    	1 cup walnuts
    	2 cups lightly packed fresh basil leaves
    	1 tablespoon cider vinegar
    	1 teaspoon kosher salt
    	1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
    	1 cup olive oil (I use a mixture of olive and avocado, but all of either would be fine)

Directions
    Heat grill to medium (about 350°F) with a grill basket resting on grates. Cut cabbage 	lengthwise into 1-inch wedges; cut crosswise into 1-inch pieces. Combine broccolini, 	cabbage, and walnuts in a medium bowl; toss with olive oil and generous pinches of 	salt and pepper until well-coated.
    Add salad ingredients to grill basket; cover grill and lower temperature to medium-low. 	Grill, covered, until vegetables are slightly charred around edges but crisp and 	nuts are a deep golden brown, about 15 minutes, tossing every 5 minutes. Return 	cooked vegetables to bowl.
    Drizzle salad with vinaigrette and serve warm.

    Basil-Walnut Vinaigrette
    	Preheat oven to 350°F. Scatter walnuts over a baking tray in a single layer and 		toast, tossing once, until fragrant and golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Set 		aside to cool completely.
    	Combine walnuts, basil, vinegar, salt and pepper and about 1/4 cup oil in a blender 		jar; blend until smooth. With the motor running, drizzle in remaining olive 			oil. Scrape dressing into a jar or other airtight container and store, 		refrigerated, up to 2 weeks. (It will become solid when refrigerated.) To 		loosen dressing, set it out at room temperature for a few hours or place 		sealed jar in a mug of hot water for 10 minutes.
